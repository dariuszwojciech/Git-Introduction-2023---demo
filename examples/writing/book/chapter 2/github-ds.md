> Many modern IDEs (but also online services, such as Databricks) integrate with git repositories. Some better, some worse.
> I use PyCharm and Visual Studio Code and they both work really well with git.
> You might still want to learn git commands - it's worth it in the long run.

> You can work with git locally or remotely. I would suggest you create a free account on GitHub and create private/public repositories.
> You can create organisations (with private repositories) - you can work on those on your own (and I do a lot of that), but you can also invite other people to work on them with you.
> This means nothing is stopping you from collaborating with others on your projects (whether they're code, writing, books, etc.). You can play as much as you like - break a lot of things (knowing you can often go back to a point before you break stuff) and learn!
> There's nothing better than learning by doing!
