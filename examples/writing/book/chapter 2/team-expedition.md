# Hi Team!

We are going to have our first chat today (31st March 2023) - "DE - Squad level team meeting" - it is only 30 minutes, but I think that together we can figure out what we want out of these in the future.

This is going to be a short exploration into what you would like me to do for you in the future. I have many ideas, but I always want to hear from you and I would like this to be something we do together.

### First things first
- think about a name for our team (so that I won't have to address you with "Hi Team" or "Hi all") - we don't have to decide on it now, but if there's something you like, we can make it quick and easy - I can always draw on something from one of my obsessions (a Mexican theme, for example) - but your ideas could be much better!
- nothing is set in stone, so if there's something you don't like, we can change it (iterative approach to avoid boredom)
- think about three goals around the reasons why you're here (nothing formal, just something to keep in mind) - and if you want, share one with us 

### My initial thoughts
Who are we and what do we want to do? And hopefully, over time, we will figure out how to do it. I have a few ideas, but I will always ask you for your input and suggestions.

This is a safe place - we can talk about anything: technical, non-technical, fun, not-so-much fun, etc. This is about sharing, reflecting on stuff, and solving interesting problems.

Thanks, that's all for now and we will talk later! See you then!
