### What are these tools?
These are the tools that I have been using for a while, and I believe that many of them will be around for a while.
Some of them are too niche and look deceptively simple or not that useful. To me, they have been essential in my professional life.
If they are gone, then I will be very disappointed (and looking for or building alternatives).

> If you have any questions about any of these tools, please feel free to contact me.

There are many more tha won't end up here, as they're too ephemeral, or I don't believe they're worth mentioning - tools come and go, so that's why.

This page will be updated from time to time, so as always, watch this space!

### A
`Alloy` - Alloy is an open source language and analyzer for software modeling. [ref](https://alloytools.org/)

### G
`Git` - version control system (one of the best ones on my long version control tools journey); if you work with files (or write anything), you're missing out and risking a lot. [ref](https://git-scm.com/)

### O
`Obsidian` - Obsidian is a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files. [ref](https://obsidian.md/)

### P
`PAT` - PAT is a self-contained framework for to support composing, simulating and reasoning of concurrent, real-time systems and other possible domains. [ref](https://pat.comp.nus.edu.sg/)

`PlantUML` - Diagrams generated from text - simple, but powerful [ref](https://plantuml.com/)

`PRISM` - PRISM is a probabilistic model checker, a tool for formal modelling and analysis of systems that exhibit random or probabilistic behaviour [PRISM Model Checker](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org)

`ProB` - Process animator and model checked. I am only interested in its CSP-M modelling. [ref](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=Main_Page)

`Python` - with loads of interesting [libraries I cherish]({{< ref "fav-python-libraries" >}})

`PyCharm` - Python IDE - there are many reasons why I like it.

### R
`RobotFramework` - if you need to do automated testing (whether it is browser-based, headless or any automation based on custom Python and/or keyword), and you can't stand Selenium and its brittleness around HTML, CSS, etc., this is something you need in your life. Honestly, don't even bother with selenium (sic), unless you really don't care about maintainability, you don't like people who will work with your code, or you just don't like your future self!

### U
`UML` - Unified Modelling Language (many tools I found useful since 1999 - currently I am after tools that are UML 2.5, with rich meta-modelling capabilities - surprisingly, code generation is here to stay, one way or another, visible or hidden) [ref](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/)
