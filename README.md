git as version control

local - useful for working locally (not collaboration with others)
useful for working locally: software code, text, writing, websites, assets like images, etc.

remote - remote (allows for easy collaboration with others)



git vs. GitHub (there are other providers, e.g., BitBucket, Azure DevOps, GitLab)


Available tools for working with git:
- git command line
- GitHub Desktop (others: Sourcetree)
- integration with IDE (PyCharm, Visual Studio Code)


branching: master/main and other branches (e.g., feature branches)
pull request
merging


Not trivial -  worth learning and often essential:
- merging and resolving conflicts
- working with large files (especially binary files)



# demo today
1. created from scratch
2. cloned existing repository

- simple folder with files

git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit ever"


Open in IDE
Add .gitignore file

Create remote on GitHub
